# Consumer Profit Dashboard — Insights
> Project 01 — Retail Profitability Optimization  
> Data-driven insights using SQL + Power BI

## Business Objective  
Identify where the business is winning, where margin erosion occurs, and what strategic actions can improve profitability across segments, categories, and regions.

---

## Key Findings

- Consumer segment is the primary profit driver, contributing the highest total profit across all segments.  
- Technology is the leading profit category ($531), followed by Furniture — both deliver strong margins.  
- EU West is the strongest region ($616 profit), driven by Technology + Consumer sales; this region is a high-ROI focus area.  
- Office Supplies underperforms across multiple regions and segments, both in volume contribution and profitability.  
- February profit dropped sharply vs January, despite similar order volume — a clear margin erosion issue rather than demand decline.  
- The decline originates from Technology, especially within Consumer and Home Office segments.

## Root Cause Analysis

The February drop is margin-driven, not volume-driven:

- Total orders remained stable.  
- Average Profit Per Order fell significantly, largely within Technology.  
- Discount patterns indicate that higher-discount orders in February contributed to profit decline.  
- Product mix shifted toward lower-margin combinations.

This suggests issues with pricing, discounting, or product mix rather than customer demand.

## Recommendations

### 1. Scale Consumer + Technology (highest profit engine)
- Prioritize inventory readiness, targeted marketing, and premium pricing strategies.  
- Protect Technology margins by tightening discount policies in key regions.

### 2. Increase Furniture order volume
- Strong margins but low volume; promotions or bundling can unlock profit growth.

### 3. Repair Office Supplies performance
- Review SKU-level profitability, negotiate cost improvements, or refresh product assortment.

### 4. Investigate February discounting & margin leakage
- Analyze discount band changes and promotional campaigns that led to lower margins.  
- Align discount rules with profitability targets.

### 5. Maintain Corporate segment efficiently
- Stable but low-volume; nurture existing relationships without heavy investment.
