# Consumer Profit Dashboard — Insights

## Business Objective  
Analyze profitability trends to identify where the business is winning, where it is losing margin, and what actions can improve future performance.

---

## Key Findings  

- Consumer segment is the profit engine of the business, contributing the highest share of total profit.  
- Within Consumer, Technology and Furniture deliver strong profitability, while Office Supplies underperforms.  
- February profit dropped sharply compared to January, even though order volume stayed similar.  
- The main driver of this drop is a collapse in Technology profit, especially for Consumer and Home Office segments.  
- Corporate segment remains small but relatively stable – low risk, but limited upside.

## Root Cause  

The February decline is margin-driven, not volume-driven:  
- Orders did not fall dramatically, but  
- Average profit per order fell, especially in Technology.  

This points to a change in product mix, discounting, or cost structure rather than demand.

## Recommendations  

1. Double down on Consumer + Technology  
   - Protect and grow the highest-margin product/segment combination.  

2. Boost Furniture order volume  
   - Furniture margins are strong; increasing order count will raise total profit.  

3. Fix Office Supplies performance  
   - Review pricing, discounts, and product portfolio to bring margins up to target.  

4. Investigate February margin erosion  
   - Analyze discounts, campaigns, and operational costs specific to February.  

5. Maintain Corporate segment efficiently  
   - Keep engagement, but avoid overspending on a low-volume segment.
