## Project 01 — Retail Profitability Optimization  
Power BI — Consumer Profit Strategy Dashboard

Dataset: Superstore  
Tools: Power BI Desktop  

Goal  
Identify where the business is winning, where margins drop, and what actions will improve profitability.

What I built  
A 6-page Power BI report that covers:  
1. Segment / Category / Region Overview (executive KPI summary).  
2. Profit by Segment and Category (Avg Profit per Order, margin patterns).  
3. Monthly Performance & Trends (month-over-month profit and order shifts).  
4. Regional Profit Heatmap & Strategy (region × category × segment view).  
5. EU West Deep Dive (region deep-dive and profit-share analysis).  
6. Discount Impact & Summary (discount band analysis and profit leakage).

Key Findings  
- Consumer segment delivers the highest total profit — primary growth opportunity.  
- Technology is the top category by profit ($531) and should be prioritized for promotions & availability.  
- EU West is the highest-profit region ($616) — focus premium pricing and stock readiness there.  
- Discount strategy: majority of profit comes from no/low-discount sales — review discount policies to protect margin.  
- February shows a drop in Technology profit driven by weaker Consumer engagement — targeted recovery promotions recommended.

## Project 02 — SAC Superstore Sales & Profit Analytics  
SAP Analytics Cloud — 4-Page Interactive Story

Dataset: Superstore  
Tools: SAP Analytics Cloud (Story Builder)

Goal  
Build a clean, multi-page analytics story to highlight sales, profit, segment, regional, and customer performance using SAC’s story design capabilities.

What I built  
A 4-page SAC story with:  
1. Executive Overview — KPIs, profit margin, regional filter, sales trend.  
2. Category Performance — category → sub-category breakdown, top products, region-based filtering.  
3. Regional Performance — sales/profit by region, margin comparison, category mix by region.  
4. Customer Performance — customer KPIs, Top 10 customers by profit, segment-level analysis, narrative insights.

Key Findings  
- EU West leads in sales and profit performance.  
- Technology and Furniture categories contribute strongly across regions.  
- Customer profitability is concentrated — top customers drive a large share of profit.  
- Customer segment differences reveal where targeted marketing can improve returns.
