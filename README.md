## Project 01 — Retail Profitability Optimization  
Power BI — Consumer Profit Strategy Dashboard  

Dataset: Superstore  
Tools: Power BI Desktop  

### Goal  
Identify where the business is winning, where margins drop, and what actions will improve profitability.

### What I Built  
A 6-page Power BI report that covers:  
1. Segment / Category / Region Overview — executive KPI summary  
2. Profit by Segment and Category — average profit per order and margin patterns  
3. Monthly Performance & Trends — month-over-month profit and order shifts  
4. Regional Profit Heatmap & Strategy — region × category × segment analysis  
5. EU West Deep Dive — regional deep-dive and profit-share analysis  
6. Discount Impact & Summary — discount band analysis and profit leakage  

### Key Findings  
- Consumer segment delivers the highest total profit — primary growth opportunity.  
- Technology is the top category by profit ($531) and should be prioritized for promotions and availability.  
- EU West is the highest-profit region ($616) — focus premium pricing and stock readiness there.  
- Discount strategy insight: majority of profit comes from no/low-discount sales — review discount policies to protect margin.  
- February shows a drop in Technology profit driven by weaker Consumer engagement — targeted recovery promotions recommended.

## Project 02 — SAC Superstore Sales & Profit Analytics  
SAP Analytics Cloud — Retail Profitability Analysis  

Dataset: Superstore  
Tools: SAP Analytics Cloud (Story Builder)  

### Goal  
Analyze sales, profit, and margin performance across categories, regions, and customers using SAP Analytics Cloud, and demonstrate enterprise-style BI storytelling.

### What I Built  
A 4-page SAC analytics story structured as a guided business narrative:  
1. Executive Overview — KPIs, profit margin, regional filter, sales trend  
2. Category Performance — category to sub-category breakdown, top products, region-based filtering  
3. Regional Performance — sales and profit by region, margin comparison, category mix  
4. Customer Performance — customer KPIs, Top 10 customers by profit, segment-level insights with narrative commentary  

### Key Findings  
- EU West leads in both sales and profit performance.  
- Technology and Furniture categories contribute strongly across regions.  
- Customer profitability is concentrated — a small group of customers drives a large share of profit.  
- Segment-level differences indicate where targeted marketing can improve returns.

## Project 03 — Manufacturing FP&A Performance Analysis  
Power BI — Financial Planning & Analysis (Actual vs Budget)  

Focus: Management reporting, variance analysis, and executive decision support
Dataset: Synthetic Manufacturing FP&A data modeled to reflect real-world FP&A structures  
Tools: Power BI Desktop  

### Goal  
Demonstrate FP&A-style financial performance analysis by comparing Actual vs Budget results, explaining operating profit variance, and presenting executive-ready management views.

### What I Built  
A multi-page Power BI report designed around FP&A best practices:  
1. Operating Performance Overview — YTD KPIs (Revenue, Operating Profit, Margin) with monthly Actual vs Budget trends  
2. Operating Profit Variance Bridge — structured variance explanation using Revenue, COGS, and Opex impacts  
3. Interactive Tooltips — month-level context delivered without cluttering executive-level views  

### Key Insights  
- High-level revenue performance can mask underlying margin pressure, which becomes visible only through profit variance analysis.  
- Monthly volatility highlights the importance of separating topline performance from cost behavior.  
- Variance bridge clearly shows how revenue, COGS, and Opex drivers combine to impact Operating Profit — mirroring real FP&A review discussions.  
- Executive KPIs enable fast performance assessment, while deeper visuals support follow-up analysis.
