## Project 01 — Retail Profitability Optimization  
Analysis using SQL + Power BI

---

### Business Objective  
Identify where the business is winning, where margins drop, and what actions will improve profitability.

---

### Key Findings
- Consumer segment drives the majority of profit  
- Technology & Furniture deliver strong margins; Office Supplies underperforms  
- February profit dropped sharply despite similar order volume  
- Decline driven by margin erosion in Technology category  
- Corporate segment remains stable but low-growth  

---

### Root Cause
The February decline is margin-driven, not demand-driven:

| Metric | January | February | Insight |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Order count | Similar | Similar | No demand issue |
| Avg profit/order | High | Much lower | Margin collapse |
| Tech profit | Very high | Severely dropped | Key driver |

➡ Product mix, discounts, or cost structure need review.

---

### Recommendations
1️⃣ Double down on Consumer + Technology – protect and expand the strongest combination  
2️⃣ Grow Furniture order volume — high margins, underutilized opportunity  
3️⃣ Fix Office Supplies pricing & profitability  
4️⃣ Investigate February discounts & operational issues  
5️⃣ Maintain Corporate segment efficiently — no overspending
