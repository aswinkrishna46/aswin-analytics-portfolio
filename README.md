## Project 01 — Retail Profitability Optimization  
Power BI — Consumer Profit Strategy Dashboard

Dataset: Superstore
Tools: Power BI Desktop 

Goal  
Identify where the business is winning, where margins drop, and what actions will improve profitability.

What I built  
A 6-page Power BI report that covers:
1. Segment / Category / Region Overview (executive KPI summary).  
2. Profit by Segment and Category (matrix-style analysis with Avg Profit per Order).  
3. Monthly Performance & Trends (month-over-month profit and order trends).  
4. Regional Profit Heatmap & Strategy (region × category × segment view).  
5. EU West Deep Dive (region deep-dive and profit-share analysis).  
6. Discount Impact & Summary (discount band analysis and profit impact).

Key Findings  
- Consumer segment delivers the highest total profit — primary growth opportunity.  
- Technology is the top category by profit ($531) and should be prioritized for promotions & availability.  
- EU West is the highest-profit region ($616) — focus premium pricing and stock readiness there.  
- Discount strategy: majority of profit comes from no/low-discount sales — review discount policies to protect margin.  
- February shows a drop in Technology profit driven by weaker Consumer engagement — targeted recovery promotions recommended.
